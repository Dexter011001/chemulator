# **Chemulator**

An app for A-level chemistry students.

### Origin for Idea
As a chemistry student myself, I found it tedious to do chemical calculations for my lab experiments. I thought to myself that this could easily be automated using an app, however, I could not find any that suited my needs. Thus after high school, I decided to create one myself that would fit the needs of A-level student.
The app was a success and I got an article written by the national Mauritian Press (DefiMedia). 

### Description

Chemulator helps A-level chemistry students to do their homework. It faciliates long and tedious chemistry calculations by providing features such as:-
- Periodic Element information lookup
- Stoichemistry Formula calculator
- Chemical Mass calculator

These calculators make it easier for chemistry students to complete their homework
### Technologies used

The app was designed using React Native and Javascript. The backend used NodeJs and expressJs to perform API calls.
